    array(['M', 'B'], dtype=object)



#### Brief description of the data
- Total 569 records of patients and 33 columns
- id is a unique column that does not contribue to prediction
- unnamed: 32 is a column with no value in it and hence cannot contribute
- diagnosis is an object type feature with only two values: M and B
- diagnosis is the target variable with two categories: M and B
- Remaining all the columns are float type and act as predictor variables

#### Basic Preprocessing


```python
# Remove features 'id' & 'Unnamed: 32' since they do not help in predicting
bio = bio.drop(['id', 'Unnamed: 32'],axis=1)
```


```python
# Encoding target variable 'diagnosis'
bio['diagnosis'] = bio['diagnosis'].map({'M': 0,'B': 1})

#Encoding: a preprocessing technique used to convert categorical variables to number codes.
```


```python
bio.head()
```

```python
bio.shape
```




    (569, 31)



#### Above dataset is finally transformed with all numerical values. 30 predictor variables and 1 target variable.

### Splitting the dataset into X and y


```python
X = bio.drop(['diagnosis'],axis = 1)
y = bio['diagnosis']
```


```python
X_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=1/3,random_state=32)
```

#### Logistic regression is a distance based model, hence all numerical features must be scaled.


```python
ss = StandardScaler()
X_train = ss.fit_transform(X_train)
x_test = ss.transform(x_test)
```

### Basic model training and inferencing

#### Instantiation and training


```python
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=10)
model = lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Inferencing


```python
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
```

#### Evaluation


```python
print(accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred))
```

    0.9578947368421052



```python
print(model.get_params)
```

    <bound method BaseEstimator.get_params of LogisticRegression(random_state=10)>


### Hyperparameters Finetuning
#### Hyperparameters used:
- penalty: L1 , L2 and elasticnet. By default penalty is L2.
- C: regularization parameter. This depicts the complexity of model
- solver: Optimization problems can be solved by different solvers
- max_iters: in how many steps the global minima is reached


```python
param_grid = [    
    {'penalty' : ['l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'],
    'C' : np.logspace(-4, 4, 20),
    'solver' : ['lbfgs','newton-cg','liblinear','sag','saga'],
    'max_iter' : [10, 50, 100, 1000]
    }
]

3*20*5*4
```




    1200




```python
np.logspace(-4,4,20)   #.0001 to 10000
```




    array([1.00000000e-04, 2.63665090e-04, 6.95192796e-04, 1.83298071e-03,
           4.83293024e-03, 1.27427499e-02, 3.35981829e-02, 8.85866790e-02,
           2.33572147e-01, 6.15848211e-01, 1.62377674e+00, 4.28133240e+00,
           1.12883789e+01, 2.97635144e+01, 7.84759970e+01, 2.06913808e+02,

#### Comments:
- It is just way to give range of values that c can take.
- You may also use the simple approach as shown below:
- 'C' : [.0001, .001, .01, .1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]


```python
gsc = GridSearchCV(lr, param_grid = param_grid, cv = 10,verbose=True, n_jobs=-1)
tuned_model = gsc.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

### Observations:
- The highest accuracy is obtained after finetuning the model.
- Base model accuracy: 95.79%; Fine-tuned model accuracy: 96.84%

- With L1 penalty specific experiment is done just to verify the results.
- The coefficients of L1 model show how many feature coefficients are equated to zero.
- So L1 does help in feature selection. All non-zero coefficient features are considered for final model.
